# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-from-MRI-Images
 This study leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques for Alzheimer's Disease detection using MRI images. Using state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, the proposed methodology employs transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG16 for feature extraction and classification.
